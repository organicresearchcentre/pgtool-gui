**PG Tool Online v3.1 Manual**

Welcome to the manual for the Public Goods Tool (PG Tool) Online v3.1. This manual will provide a guide to using the current online version of PG Tools. For information on the development and future use of the PG Tool, please see [PG Tool Online v3.1 Development](https://github.com/organicresearchcentre/pgtool-gui/blob/main/PG%20Tool%20Online%20Development.md)
 ##
**What is the PG Tool?**

The PG Tool has been developed to capture the production of public goods and overall sustainability of land management practices, with an emphasis on farmland and agriculture. The tool takes various data inputs and scores them in a non-weighted system, producing a single score (1-5) for each indicator. There are a total of 12 indicators (AKA categories) in v3.1, along with an initial data collection category. The final score for each indicator is then visualised in a results category featuring a web-diagram and a more in-depth bar chart for further analysis.
 
While the tool is useful in visualising the current state of public goods and sustainability of managed land, it should be used alongside other resources and expert advice to help develop a wider understanding of farm sustainability. The tool may highlight areas of concern or excellence in a particular indicator, but further research should be done into the true reasons behind these scores in order to ensure any action taken will have the desired impact.
 
**Who is it meant for?**

The PG Tool Online v3.1 is open for anyone who is interested to use. It is geared towards farmers and land managers, although the tool is adaptable to many situations. For more details about the development and adaptation of the PG Tool to specific scenarios and/or research needs, please see "PG Tool Online v3.1 Development".

**Starting an Assessment**

The base version of the PG Tool can be found at the [Organic Research Centre website](https://www.organicresearchcentre.com/PG-Tool/).
On opening the tool you will be met with a tab which contains 14 categories. To begin we will name the assessment by clicking on the pencil icon in the top left. You can edit the name of the assessment at any time.
Once the assessment is named we will click on the first category, "Initial data". This will bring up the first data collection page. Go through each of the fields inputting the relevant data.

**Completing an Assessment**

Grey fields will be automatically populated based on previous answers. It is worth double checking these numbers makes sense.
Where additional clarification is required for the type of data being asked there will be a short description or a ? which can be hovered over for further information.
Questions marked with a red * are required in order to calculate the final scores. **All required questions within a category must be answered for a score to be generated.** Other questions are optional but will help in identifying potential reasons for a score.

Once the "initial data" page has been completed, click on the "categories" tab on the top right to open up the menu again. Select the next category, "Soil management". Continue to fill out the page and select the next category until you reach the final "Scores".

**Saving and Opening an Assessment**

 The data you input is not stored on a web server and must be saved and re-uploaded manually. Saving an assessment can be done at anytime by clicking on the top right "save" icon. This will then open a window prompting you to confirm the name of the file, choose if you want to anonymise the file (i.e. remove names), and then save it. This will then be downloaded as a JSON file to your computer.
To open a partially or fully completed assessment, click on the "open" icon  on the top right. This will open another window where you can click "choose file" and then select the previously saved JSON file. Then simply press "load data".
When going back to edit an assessment, the scores can be updated to account for new information by clicking on the lower left button marked "Update score".
Two example farms have been filled out and saved ad example_farms.json, included in this download. Using these can help you learn to load in the assessments and provides a benchmark for your assessment.

**Duplicating, Deleting, and Starting Multiple Assessments**

On the top left tab, next to where the assessment name is edited, there are further options. The small square icon will allow you to duplicate the current assessment with all of its included data. The cross will delete the current assessment and all its data. **This is non-reversible so it is recommended to save your assessment regularly**. Multiple new assessments can be created by clicking on the "+ New assessment" button.
##
**Troubleshooting and Support**

If you are having difficulties entering information or using the PG Tools online then please contact your project researcher or send a query to [github@organicresearchcentre.com](mailto:github@organicresearchcentre.com) along with the saved JSON file of your assessment.
